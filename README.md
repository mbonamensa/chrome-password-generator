# Chrome Password Generator
This random password generator is a chrome extension that I use personally. You're welcome to download the files and use them as well :)

## Steps to add extension to your Chrome browser locally.
1. Download the files from the repository.
2. Type (or copy and paste) "**chrome://extensions/**" in your browser.
3. Toggle **developer mode**. i.e. make sure it's on. This will be on the top right side of the page.
4. On the left side of the page, click on **load upacked**.
5. Navigate to the folder that contains the files you downloaded. Remeber to unzip them.
6. Select the folder. This will add the extension to your extensions.
